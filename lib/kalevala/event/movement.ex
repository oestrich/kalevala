defmodule Kalevala.Event.Movement.Request do
  @moduledoc """
  Character requesting to move from their current room in a exit_name

  A move request transitions through several stages before commiting or aborting.

  The character requests the room to move in a exit_name.

  ```
  %Kalevala.Event{
    topic: Kalevala.Event.Movement.Request,
    data: %Kalevala.Event.Movement.Request{
      character: character,
      exit_name: "north"
    }
  }
  ```

  The room process sends a voting event to the Zone after determining that there is
  a valid exit in this exit_name.

  ```
  %Kalevala.Event{
    topic: Kalevala.Event.Movement.Voting,
    data: %Kalevala.Event.Movement.Voting{
      character: character,
      from: start_room_id,
      to: end_room_id,
      exit_name: "north"
    }
  }
  ```

  The zone then asks the `to` and `from` room if they are OK with the character moving. Each
  room will be `GenServer.call`ed to block and keep this synchronous. The room `movement/2`
  callback will be called for each room, so they can vote on the movement. Return the event
  with `aborted: true` to reject movement.

  `Kalevala.Event.Movement.Commit` - After both room's agree that the player can move,
  the zone sends this event to the character.

  ```
  %Kalevala.Event{
    topic: Kalevala.Event.Movement.Commit,
    data: %Movement.Commit{
      character: character,
      from: start_room_id,
      to: end_room_id,
      exit_name: "north"
    }
  }
  ```

  `Kalevala.Event.Movement.Abort` - If either room rejects the movement, the zone will
  respond with an abort.

  ```
  %Kalevala.Event{
    topic: Kalevala.Event.Movement.Abort,
    data: %Kalevala.Event.Movement.Abort{
      character: character,
      from: start_room_id,
      to: end_room_id,
      exit_name: "north",
      reason: :door_locked
    }
  }

    topic: Kalevala.Event.Movement.Abort,
    data: %Kalevala.Event.Movement.Abort{

      from: start_room_id,
      exit_name: "north",
      reason: :no_exit
    }
  }
  ```

  On a commit, the player leaves the old room, and enters the new one.

  ```
  %Kalevala.Event{
    topic: Kalevala.Event.Movement,
    data: %Kalevala.Event.Movement{
      character: character,
      direction: :to,
